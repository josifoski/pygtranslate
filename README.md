# pygtranslate
Python tkinter script using google translate web services and goslate module
  
Spelling is included, you'll have to connect dict files in script.   
  
## Dependancies  
goslate  
pip3 install goslate  


## Usage
Simply run the script with python3.4+  
shortcut for translation is set to Ctrl + r  
shortcut for continuous saving if used as editor Ctrl + s  
  
## Google services note  
Lately google put restrictions for free translate using script (several translations daily),  
is there <b>easy payable method</b> to enlarge number of translations or per characters (present) or something else?
